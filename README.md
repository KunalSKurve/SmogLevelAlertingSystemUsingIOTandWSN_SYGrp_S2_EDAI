# SmogLevelAlertingSystem_SYGrp
Air pollution is a primary concern for humankind, causing asthma attacks, wheezing, shortness in breath, etc. In the Indian subcontinent, air quality decreases, increasing smog due to the burning of crops to prepare for the harvest and emissions from vehicles, etc. Driving becomes difficult due to this blinding smog. To overcome these problems, a wireless network of sensors is proposed along the expressways and in public places to measure the smog. A personal area network (PAN) network of motes is set up. Using MQ135 and DSM501a sensors, smog pollutants are measured. Contiki OS and Cooja simulator are used to analyze the performance of a network by emulating nodes using Tmote Sky. The nodes in this PAN are mounted over the lamp posts on the bridge to collect information of various pollutants and send the acquired data to a mote. This mote acts as a central node in the wireless sensor network (WSN) and transmits data over user datagram protocol (UDP). Finally, the parameters with warning messages are displayed at the entrance of bridges for the drivers to create a safety alert. The future aspect of this project may lead to displaying the messages at short intervals along the whole bridge with updated values. Also, the recorded data can be stored on the server and after a certain period of time, the data can be analyzed to observe the number of pollutants being emitted, and measures can be taken accordingly.
